# lookout v1 live-testing checklist

Tracks which v1 features have been exercised against a real Docker daemon / real registry, as
opposed to only the unit/fixture test suite. This is the readiness gate for cutting a `1.0.0` tag
— see CLAUDE.md's "Testing conventions" section for why fixture/fake tests alone haven't caught
every real bug in this codebase.

## Confirmed live

- [x] Core recreate flow: stop -> create -> start (`docker/client.py`, `docker/recreate.py`) —
      caught the bridge-network-swap bug during original development
- [x] Bind mounts, named volumes, multiple custom networks with aliases, restart policy,
      healthchecks (`docker/recreate.py`) — captured as real inspect fixtures from live containers
- [x] Registry digest lookup against Docker Hub, GHCR, and a personal basic-auth-only registry
      (`registry/digest.py`) — caught GHCR's bogus probe-scope bug
- [x] RepoDigests-orphaning staleness fallback (`core/updater._is_stale`) — caught by rebuilding
      and repushing the same tag on the same host running lookout
- [x] Scheduler SIGTERM/SIGINT handling within ~1s (`scheduler.py`)
- [x] Self-container detection via `/proc/self/mountinfo` (`core/filter.py`) — caught the
      Portainer stale-`$HOSTNAME` bug
- [x] `--label-enable` filtering — confirmed 2026-07-13
- [x] SELinux bind-mount/volume relabeling (`:z`/`:Z`) carried over via legacy `Binds` strings
      alongside the modern `mounts` list (`docker/recreate.py` `_build_mounts`,
      `docker/client.py` `DockerPyClient._create`) — confirmed live 2026-07-14 on a real
      SELinux-enforcing RHEL 9 host (Docker CE 29.6.1 with `selinux-enabled: true` explicitly set;
      it's *not* on by default even on an SELinux-enforcing host — Docker CE only enables container
      SELinux separation when told to). Verified against a real container with a `:z` shared bind
      (read-write), a `:Z` private bind (read-only), a plain unlabeled bind (still correctly denied
      by SELinux both before and after recreate), and a `:z` named volume — all four preserved
      correct read/write behavior across a real stop/recreate/start cycle. This also caught a real
      bug in `docker-py` itself: its high-level `containers.create(volumes=[...])` independently
      derives `Config.Volumes` from the same bind strings via a helper
      (`_host_volume_from_bind`) that only understands a plain `ro`/`rw` mode suffix — given a
      compound mode like `rw,z` it fell through to using the raw `dest:mode` tail as a volume
      destination, silently creating garbage anonymous volumes alongside the correct bind (the
      `HostConfig.Binds` entry itself was fine; only the `Config.Volumes` side effect was
      wrong). Worked around by building the `HostConfig` via the low-level API instead
      (`DockerPyClient._create()`), which passes bind strings straight through with no such
      parsing. Real fixture captured: `tests/fixtures/inspect/selinux-relabel.json`.
- [x] Static per-network IPv4/IPv6 address and MAC address carried over on recreate
      (`docker/recreate.py` `_build_networks`, `docker/client.py` `recreate`) — confirmed live
      2026-07-14: a container on a custom network (with an IPv6 subnet) started with `--ip`,
      `--ip6`, `--mac-address`, and a network alias survived a real stop/recreate/start cycle with
      all four preserved exactly. No bugs found this time — unlike the SELinux item above,
      `docker-py`'s `Network.connect()` does correctly accept and apply the forwarded `mac_address`
      kwarg (previously only verified by reading its source, not exercised against a real daemon).
      Real fixture captured: `tests/fixtures/inspect/static-ip-mac.json`.

## Not yet confirmed live

- [ ] Lifecycle hooks: pre-update / post-update (`core/lifecycle.py`) — also has no unit tests
- [ ] Notifications via Apprise (`notifications/notify.py`)
- [ ] Private-registry credential reading from `~/.docker/config.json` (`registry/auth.py`)
- [ ] Image cleanup after update, `--cleanup` (`core/updater._cleanup_images`) — documented as
      best-effort/unverified
- [ ] Dependency-ordered stop/start (`stop_order`, container links / `depends-on` label)
- [ ] `--monitor-only`
- [ ] `--no-pull`
- [ ] `--include` / `--exclude` name filtering

## New since the 2026-07-14 code review pass — need first-time live verification

- [ ] Rename-first `recreate()` (`docker/client.py`) — replaces the old remove-then-create flow;
      needs a real create-failure case exercised (a rejected `HostConfig` field, a vanished
      network) to prove the old container survives instead of being lost
- [ ] No-pull restart-loop guard (`core/updater.py`) — needs confirming alongside `--no-pull`
      itself
- [ ] Post-update hook errors no longer mark a successful update as failed (`core/updater.py`) —
      needs confirming alongside lifecycle hooks
- [ ] Explicit tmpfs-mount skip in recreate (`docker/recreate.py` `_build_mounts`) — confirm a
      container with a tmpfs mount recreates cleanly without it
- [ ] Ulimits/sysctls/devices/dns/extra_hosts/tmpfs carried over on recreate (`docker/recreate.py`)
      — needs a container actually using each of these to confirm the new create-kwargs are
      accepted by a live daemon
- [ ] `container:<id>` NetworkMode resolved to `container:<name>` at listing time
      (`docker/client.py` `_resolve_network_mode_container_ref`) — confirm against a container
      whose network mode is `container:<other-container>`, and confirm the target surviving its
      own recreation doesn't break this one
- [ ] Resource limits (`mem_limit`, `nano_cpus`, `cpu_shares`, `memswap_limit`, `pids_limit`)
      carried over on recreate (`docker/recreate.py`) — confirm against a container started with
      `--memory`/`--cpus`/`--pids-limit` set
- [ ] `log_config`/`security_opt`/`group_add`/`read_only`/`shm_size`/`init`/`stop_signal`/
      `stop_timeout`/`pid_mode`/`ipc_mode` carried over on recreate (`docker/recreate.py`) —
      confirm against a container started with `--log-opt`, `--security-opt`, `--read-only`,
      `--init`, `--stop-signal`, `--pid=host`, and `--ipc=shareable` set
